## About ezpkg.io

As I work on various Go projects, I often find myself creating utility functions, extending existing packages, or developing packages to solve specific problems. Moving from one project to another, I usually have to copy or rewrite these solutions. So I created this repository to have all these utilities and packages in one place. Hopefully, you'll find them useful as well.

For more information, see the [main repository](https://github.com/ezpkg/ezpkg).
